**Project Status at Start of Meeting:**  
The project currently has designs for three of the four main landing pages of the website: *home*, *my shelf*, and *search results*. The base HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for the *home* page has been written and is functional-- as much as is feasible without database connection. Team members have researched how we will integrate data from Project Gutenberg, as well as the APIs available from Open Library. Members report that the database has been migrated and the server is in a runnable state on local. 

**Reports for In-Progress Work:**  
Talia:     
Talia worked on initial designs last week for the *my shelf* and *search results* landing pages. This week they will design and share a mock-up for the *featured* page. Upon team approval, Talia will then proceed to develop the code for the *featured* page. 

Greg:  
Last week, Greg developed the initial HTML, CSS, and Javascript code for the *home* page. This week, he will use Talia's designs as reference to develop the base of the *my shelf* and *search results* pages. The *search results* page will be developed without the "Advanced Search" widget temporarily in order to allow other team members to provide a finalized design.

Jason & Clayton:   
In the last week, Jason and Clayton met to discuss database design and implementation. As stated above in Project Status, the database has been migrated and runs locally. 

Jason:   
This week, Jason will continue to assist Clayton in database implementation and management. He will also continue research on how to leverage our other API resources from Open Library. Jason will also begin to develop a list of feasible search categories for the "Advanced Search" widget. 

Clayton:   
Clayton will continue to develop the database implementation. He will begin integrating the data into Greg's code for the home page in order to test connections and database functionality. Clayton may also work together with Jason to brainstorm the necessary data to render each page. 

This report of status puts our team on track to meet the 03/13/2025 deadline to provide our Web Page Designs. We will discuss the necessary elements of Project Milestone 4 during our next weekly meeting to ensure task coverage.
